<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>"Hamven is a place on Earth" is loosely based on my job as a deli associate.
</p>
<p>You play as Brie, a mouse working in the Big Smart Grocery deli. Work begins normally, serving customers and joking around with coworkers. But, as time goes on, things become stranger and stranger. Consistent coworkers stop showing up (though there's always a reason to brush it off as nothing), strange new people work for a single shift then disappear, and customers begin making odd requests. Eventually, you are alone, and something is <i>wrong.</i>
</p>
<p>You finally leave your post to investigate, and find the entire store has been twisted into something terrible. The walls warp into oozing, weeping meat, squishing beneath your paws. Following the trail of flesh leads you to the deli meat cooler, where you discover <b>the rotting corpse of God</b>.
</p>
<P>You don't want to believe it, but somehow, deep down, you Know. You cannot deny what lies before you. It is an awful pile, like a body was stretched and squished, then thrown to the ground and left to decay. It has a strange, flat (human) face, unlike anything you've seen before. Then, it speaks. A thousand voices whisper of its hunger, its desire to consume and control. It is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that <b>YOU, the Player,</b> are responsible for this. As you step back, it tries to appeal to you in familiar voices. The faces of your coworkers, your friends, stretch from its flesh and beseech you to join them. As you try to run, the cooler seems to stretch on forever, twisting into freezing labrynth of freezing halls.
</p>
<p>What happens next and how the game concludes is still being written, as well as in-between details. I intend for there to be more gameplay after the horror elements kick in, and perhaps a slower reveal of God.</p>

<br>
<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
<p>
    Hamven's actual gameplay is in very rough planning. The current thought is that it begins as a management/visual novel style, interacting with coworkers and serving customers. The tone begins light and fun. The difficulty increases as coworkers disappear, leaving Brie with less help. However, I am still working out how to make slicing meat & cheese into interesting gameplay.
</p>
<p>
    Slowly, the tone shifts and things become strange. As you leave your post to investigate, gameplay switches into exploration and puzzle-solving.
</p>

<br>
<h2>The Inspiration</h2>
<p>
    The first part of Hamven takes inspiration from the Papa Louie games, taking orders and serving food to customers. The second half takes inspiration from Mad Father, solving puzzles to progress and areas with restricted movement. The meat cooler can sometimes be a tight space to squeeze through, restricting or slowing movement, and I want to combine it with a chase sequence, like Aya running from her father (a scene that <i>terrified</i> me as a kid.) 
</p>
<p>
    Hamven also takes inspiration from titles like Doki Doki Literature Club and Bugsnax, games that appear innocent on the surface before revealing their psychological horror elements, as well as DDLC's interaction with the Player themself.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>
    Many of the characters within Hamven are loosely based upon real people I interact with at work.
</p>
<h3>Brie</h3>
<p>
    Brie was initially design as a self-insert character to complain about work (and is still used this way), but came to serve as Hamven's protagonist as the universe began to develop.
